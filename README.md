## Overview
This dashboard offers an interactive way to analyze data from the Music and Mental Health Survey, exploring the relationship between mental health issues and music preferences. It provides a comprehensive view of how factors like depression, insomnia, OCD, and anxiety correlate with music choices, enabling users to identify trends across different demographic groups, such as age, gender, and music preference.
